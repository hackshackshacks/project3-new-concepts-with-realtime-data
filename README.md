# Project3
School project for [De Ceuvel](http://deceuvel.nl/) by [Jelle](https://github.com/jelleoverbeek), [Vienna](https://github.com/ViennaM) and [Koos](https://github.com/hackshackshacks)

### About De Ceuvel 
**From their website:**  
De Ceuvel is a city playground for innovation and creativity. An experiment in which we try to make sustainability tangible, understandable and fun. We love to share our knowledge and hope that it will grow, spread and multiply. Something is always going on and everybody is welcome.  
  
### Goal  
One of the projects at De Ceuvel is a [aquaponics system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3KMLZiWYns). We aimed to make the system more understandable for a broader audience (high school students for example). We did this by making short and funny animations and small pieces of text to explain the system.   
  
**Real-time data**  
The application also contains real-time data that is streamed from the installation. Every measured item contains an explanation about whether the current value is good or bad for the plants/fish. 


### The animations
All the animations are made using [Lottie](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-web) and the [Bodymovin After Effects plugin](https://aescripts.com/bodymovin/).
